\section{Introduction}
The rapid evolution of technology necessitates that researchers, particularly those in the field of Artificial Intelligence, maintain a current understanding of niche technical advancements across a diverse range of domains. While mainstream technology news provides broad coverage, newsletters authored by individual practitioners often offer a depth of insight, personal perspective, and focused analysis that is invaluable for those seeking a deeper technical understanding. These expert-driven publications can uncover emerging trends, explore specific methodologies, and provide context that is not always available in more generalized sources or company-centric communications. This report aims to identify and detail high-quality, niche technology newsletters created by individual experts. These newsletters have been evaluated based on their technical depth, specificity, author credibility, individual authorship, hosting platform, content style, community reception, and publication frequency, with the goal of providing AI Researchers with a curated list of resources relevant to their pursuit of knowledge in specialized technical areas. The increasing volume of online information underscores the challenge for researchers to efficiently identify truly valuable resources. Newsletters curated by individual experts serve as critical filters, delivering pre-selected, high-quality information within focused domains, reflecting a growing reliance on expert-driven curation for effective knowledge acquisition \citep{favikon2025orosz}.

\section{Evaluation Framework and Methodology}
The identification and evaluation of high-quality, niche technology newsletters by individual practitioners were guided by several core criteria. The primary focus was on newsletters demonstrating technical depth and specificity, meaning they delve into particular technical subjects, methodologies, or provide in-depth analysis rather than offering superficial coverage or general industry news \citep{runcloud2025worlds}. Newsletters were also required to have a niche domain focus, indicating a specialization within a well-defined area of technology, showcasing the author's deep understanding of that specific field \citep{shekhar2025distributedsystems}. Author credibility was a crucial factor, with the evaluation considering the author's demonstrable expertise, background in the relevant technical domain, online presence, professional affiliations, contributions to the field (such as open-source projects, research papers, or conference talks), and recognized industry experience \citep{favikon2025orosz}. The criterion of individual authorship ensured that the newsletters were clearly created and authored by a single person, as opposed to being produced by a company or a collective \citep{atchison2025softwareinsights}. The hosting platform was also considered, with preference given to newsletters hosted on personal websites, blogs, or platforms clearly associated with the individual author, such as Substack or a personal domain \citep{orosz2025jellypod}. Newsletters primarily found on corporate or large media platforms were not the focus of this evaluation. The content style and value proposition were assessed by reviewing recent issues or descriptions to ensure they emphasized in-depth analysis, personal experiences, or unique perspectives, offering value beyond simple news aggregation \citep{orosz2025jellypod}. Community reception and reputation were gauged by noting any mentions or recommendations within relevant technical communities, such as Hacker News or specialized forums, as indicators of quality and relevance \citep{runcloud2025worlds}. Finally, the publication frequency was noted if easily discernible, although it was not a primary factor in determining the quality of the newsletter \citep{shekhar2025distributedsystems}. The methodology employed involved examining curated lists of technology newsletters \citep{runcloud2025worlds}, exploring profiles of individuals known for their technical contributions \citep{favikon2025orosz}, reviewing available content descriptions \citep{orosz2025jellypod}, and noting any indications of community recognition, for example, the Hacker Newsletter being curated from Hacker News \citep{ctoclub2025swe}.
